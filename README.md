# nodeJS-starter-guide

A quick starter's guide to web development with NodeJS.
Take this guide as more of a reference manual but nonetheless key concepts are outlined including reference material.

## Node.js & npm

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment using Google's V8 Javascript engine (basically lets you run a standalone application powered by Javascript). To read more, here is the [official Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) website.

npm (Node.js Package Manager) is a package manager for Node.js which will allow you to install and utilise packages that may be useful to your project. Here is very useful [guide](https://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-node-package-manager/) to npm which will help you get a better understanding on how it is used.

Some important points to take out of that guide is how to:

* install/uninstall packages
* install/uninstall packages globally
* update packages
* knowing the difference between project dependencies and dev dependencies

To get started, first you will need to do is install Node.js; use [this link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download Node.js for the operating system that you are using. The download will also include npm in the installation package.

BONUS: Using different versions of Node.js may become useful at some point. This guide will show you to how to install and use [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/) but it is not crucial to know this at such a early stage.

## JavaScript

You will need to get yourself familiarized with JavaScript. HackerRank has a neat [guide to JavaScript](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-javascript). You can also use JavaScript to tackle their many challenges which can be quite useful to get yourself warmed up.

## Git

Git will play a big part in your software development and will be an essential tool. Refer to this [GitHub flow guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to get an understanding on how a typical coding cycle. This [glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) can be of help with the terminology definitions.

Some key terminology that you should get familiar are:

* clone
* checkout
* branch
* commit
* push
* pull request
* merge

With these under your belt, you have the basic tools to get yourself started with web development in Node.js.
